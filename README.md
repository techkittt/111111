The two elements for ComPDFKit PDF SDK:

- **PDF Core API**

  A parser for PDF documents (also known as PDF Data layer) doesnâ€™t include any UI components. If you just need to render a PDF document without displaying any content inside the PDF, you can just integrate this into your application.

- **PDF View**

  The rendering library for PDF documents (also known as the PDF UI layer) relies on **ComPDFKit-UI.aar**. It is a visual operation logic package for page rendering, annotation operations, and form operations. You can customize page rendering and operations based on the file library.
